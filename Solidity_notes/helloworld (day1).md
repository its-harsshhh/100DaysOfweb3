# What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. It is a computer program that runs on a blockchain platform, such as Ethereum. Smart contracts are designed to automatically enforce the terms and conditions of an agreement without the need for intermediaries or third parties.

# What are the state variables?
State variables are stored on the Ethereum blockchain and have associated storage costs and gas fees for read and write operations. Therefore, it's important to consider gas efficiency and the cost implications when working with state variables. Here, “message” is the state variable.

# What are the different visibility modifiers?
In Solidity, there are four visibility modifiers that can be used to control the accessibility of functions and state variables within a contract. These visibility modifiers are:
1. public: A public function or state variable can be accessed from both within the contract and externally. It generates an automatic getter function that allows other contracts and external users to read the value of the state variable. Public functions can be called by any other contract or external account.

2. private: A private function or state variable is only accessible within the contract where it is defined. It cannot be accessed or called from external contracts or accounts. Private functions are typically used for internal implementation details and helper functions that are not intended to be accessed externally.

3. internal: An internal function or state variable is like a private one, but it can also be accessed by contracts that inherit from the current contract. It provides visibility to both the current contract and its derived contracts. However, it is not accessible by external contracts or accounts.

4. external: An external function is like a public function, but it can only be called from external contracts or accounts. It cannot be accessed internally within the contract. External functions are typically used when you want to define an interface for other contracts to interact with your contract.

It's important to choose the appropriate visibility modifier based on the intended usage and access requirements for functions and state variables within your contract. Public and external functions are commonly used to define the contract's interface and allow other contracts or users to interact with it, while private and internal functions are used for internal implementation and encapsulation. It's worth noting that visibility modifiers can also be applied to function modifiers and event declarations to control their accessibility.

# What is a constructor?
A constructor is a special function that is automatically executed during the contract deployment process. It is used to initialize the contract's state variables or perform any other setup tasks that need to be executed when the contract is created. Key points about constructors in Solidity:
1. Name: The constructor function has the same name as the contract and does not have a return type.
2. Modifiers: The constructor can have visibility modifiers such as public, private, internal, or
external. By default, it is set to public if no visibility modifier is specified.
3. Parameters: The constructor can accept parameters, allowing you to pass initial values during contract deployment. These parameters are typically used to initialize state variables.
4. Execution: The constructor is executed only once, during the contract deployment process. It cannot be called or executed again after the contract is deployed.
5. Initialization: The constructor is used to initialize the contract's state variables, define initial contract conditions, or perform any other setup tasks required.
6. Inheritance: If a contract inherits from another contract, the base contract's constructor is not called automatically. You need to explicitly invoke the base constructor using the super keyword if initialization is required for the base contract.

# What does ‘memory’ keyword mean in Solidity?
- `memory` is a keyword used in Solidity to denote a temporary storage location.
- Variables declared with the `memory` keyword are used for storing function parameters and local variables within function execution.
- The data stored in `memory` is temporary and exists only for the duration of the function call or the contract execution.
- Data stored in `memory` is not persistent and is cleared once the function execution or contract execution is completed.

# What does ‘storage’ keyword mean in Solidity?
- `storage` is a keyword used in Solidity to denote persistent storage.
- Variables declared without any storage keyword (such as `uint myVariable `) are by default stored in `storage`.
- Data stored in `storage` is persistent and remains saved on the Ethereum blockchain.
- `storage` is used for storing state variables, which are variables that hold data across multiple function calls and throughout the entire life of the contract.
- The data stored in `storage` is updated and retrieved by different function calls and can be accessed from different parts of the contract.
To summarize:
- `memory` is used for temporary storage within a function execution and is cleared once the function execution is completed.
- `storage` is used for persistent storage of state variables, which retain their values across multiple function calls and throughout the life of the contract.
