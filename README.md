# #100DaysOfWeb3

Welcome to my #100DaysOfWeb3 repository! This repository contains my daily progress, notes, code snippets, smart contracts, and projects related to my journey into the world of Web3.

## What is #100DaysOfWeb3?

#100DaysOfWeb3 is a personal challenge I've taken on to dedicate 100 days to learning and exploring the exciting world of Web3 technologies. Throughout this journey, I'll be diving into various topics such as blockchain, decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, Web3 frameworks, and much more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- [notes/](notes/): This directory contains my daily notes and learning resources. Each day, I'll be documenting what I've learned, interesting concepts, and useful resources.

- [code/](code/): Here, you can find code snippets and examples related to the topics I'm exploring. These snippets demonstrate various aspects of Web3 development, including interacting with smart contracts, deploying DApps, and working with Web3 frameworks.

- [smartcontracts/](smartcontracts/): This directory contains the smart contracts I'm working on during my #100DaysOfWeb3 challenge. You can find Solidity code, contract deployment scripts, and related documentation.

- [projects/](projects/): In this directory, you'll find the projects I'm building throughout this challenge. Each project will showcase the practical application of Web3 technologies, such as creating decentralized applications or integrating with existing blockchain networks.

## Progress

I'll be updating my progress regularly, and you can find a detailed log of my journey in the [progress.md](progress.md) file.

## Resources

Throughout my #100DaysOfWeb3 challenge, I'll be using various resources to enhance my learning experience. Here are some of the resources I'll be referring to:

- [Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com/)
