Before directly jump into Web3.0, let's understand about Web1.0 & Web2.0

Web 1.0 = read
Web 2.0 = read/write
Web 3.0 = read/write/own

Web3 is the 3rd generation of the internet, built on decentralized technologies like blockchain. This means that users will have more control over their data and privacy, and there will be less reliance on centralized platforms.


Characteristics of Web3.0 :
Decentralization
Distributed 
Security & Privacy
Ownership
Cryptography
unmutability

Decentralization is the key concept in web3.0. It means that there is no single point of control for a system, and that power is distributed among many participants. This makes web3.0 more secure, resilent, and transparent

Blockchain are distributed ledgers that record transactions. they are secure, transparent, and tamper-proof. Blockchain are the foundation of web3, and they are enable the development of decentralized applications(dApps)

Why the data on blockchain is so secure and can't be hacked? (1/3)

1. Blockchain is a way of storing information in a way that makes it very difficult to change or hack. It is like a digital ledger that is shared across a network of computers
2. Each block in the chain contains a number of transactions, and every time a new transaction occurs on the blockchain, a record of that transaction is added to every participant's ledger.
3. This makes it very difficult to tamper with the data, as any changes would be immediately visible to everyone on the network.
